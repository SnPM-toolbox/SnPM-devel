## SnPM: Statistical nonParametric Mapping

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/12644851.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/12644851)

The Statistical non-Parametric Mapping (SnPM) toolbox provides an extensible framework for voxel level non-parametric permutation/randomisation tests of functional Neuroimaging experiments with independent observations. 

The SnPM toolbox provides an alternative to the Statistics section of [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). SnPM uses the General Linear Model to construct pseudo t-statistic images, which are then assessed for significance using a standard non-parametric multiple comparisons procedure based on randomisation/permutation testing. It is most suitable for single subject PET/SPECT analyses, or designs with low degrees of freedom available for variance estimation. In these situations the freedom to use weighted locally pooled variance estimates, or variance smoothing, makes the non-parametric approach considerably more powerful than conventional parametric approaches, as are implemented in SPM. Further, the non-parametric approach is always valid, given only minimal assumptions.

### Non-regression testing

#### Download test data and set up test data directory (first time only)
The first time you will run the tests, clone the test data (from [here](https://github.com/SnPM-toolbox/SnPM_test_data)) :
```
git clone git@github.com:SnPM-toolbox/SnPM_test_data.git
```
Then, fill in the `testDataDir` variable in `snpm_test_config.m` to point to the data you just downloaded. For example:
```
global testDataDir;
testDataDir = '~/snpm_test_data';
```
You can then untrack the configuration file in git (to avoid pushing your local configuration to the main repository):
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged test/snpm_test_config.m

```

#### Run the test suite
Then, the tests can be started with:
```
snpm_tests
```

#### Run a single test
```
run(test_oneSample, 'test_onesample_1')
```
